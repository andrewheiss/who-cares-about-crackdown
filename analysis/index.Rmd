## Abstract

Over the past two decades, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) have faced increasing legal scrutiny and repression abroad. As a result, official aid to INGOs in repressive countries has reduced. NGOs thus need access to a diverse array of funds and may need to increase fundraising from private donors. Which demographic and experiential factors influence the decision of individuals to donate to legally besieged NGOs? We investigate this question using a market simulation based on a nationally representative conjoint experiment conducted on individuals with a history of charitable giving. We find that trust in political institutions and charities is enormously influential in shaping donor preferences. Donor profiles with high levels of social trust are likely to donate to human rights INGOs with friendly relationships with host governments, and that support hold steady if INGOs face criticism or crackdown. In contrast, donor profiles with lower levels of social trust prefer to donate to organizations that do not face criticism or crackdown abroad. Our findings have practical implications for INGOs that aim to raise funds from the general public amid closing civic space.
