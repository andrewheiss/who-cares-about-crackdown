# Model details

We analyze the effect of the various combinations of organizational features and donor characteristics with the following hierarchical Bayesian multinomial logit model:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\beta &\sim \operatorname{Multivariate} \mathcal{N}(Z \Gamma, \xi) \\
y &\sim \operatorname{Multinomial\ logit}(X \beta, \varepsilon)
\end{aligned}
$$

where $y$ = which alternative the respondent chooses to donate to, $X$ = design matrix of attribute levels (i.e. organizations, issue areas, organizational practices, funding sources, and government relations), $\beta$ = latent individual preferences for the attribute levels, $Z$ = matrix of individual-level covariates (i.e. demographics, political knowledge, attitudes towards charity, etc.), $\Gamma$ = matrix of coefficients mapping individual-level covariates onto the latent individual-level preferences, and $\varepsilon$ and $\xi$ = errors. Simply put, the first level of the model predicts individual donor preferences for various combinations of features (e.g. the combination of human rights issues, financial transparency, government funding, and government crackdown), while the second level of the model uses these fitted preferences to predict the ultimate choice of donation.

We collected many individual level covariates in our survey. To aid in analysis, we categorized these survey questions into five broader theoretical themes that include smaller groups of variables. Table A\@ref(tab:individual-covariates) shows how we map individual survey questions to different groups. In this paper, we base our simulated market on a model that uses all individual characteristics in the first level:

$$
\text{Donation preferences } (\beta) \sim \operatorname{Multivariate} \mathcal{N}(Z \Gamma, \xi)
$$

where:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Z\Gamma =& \Gamma_a \text{Public affairs} + \Gamma_b\text{Political ideology} + \Gamma_c \text{Social views} + \\
& \Gamma_d \text{Charity and voluntarism} + \Gamma_e \text{Demographics}
\end{aligned}
$$

The alphabetic subscripts for the $\Gamma$ coefficients here (i.e. $\Gamma_a$) represent multiple values, since broader categories like "Public affairs" comprise multiple variables, each with their own coefficients.

The second level of the model incorporates the $\beta$ estimates from the first level and uses a design matrix of organizational characteristics:

$$
\text{Donation choice } (y) \sim \operatorname{Multinomial\ logit}(X \beta, \varepsilon)
$$

where (count of distinct values included in parentheses):

$$
\begin{aligned}
X = \{&\text{Organization } (4),\ \text{Issue area } (4),\ \text{Organizational practices } (2), \\
& \text{Funding sources } (3),\ \text{Government relations } (3)\}
\end{aligned}
$$
